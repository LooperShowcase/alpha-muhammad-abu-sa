      Apollo 11 (July 16–24, 1969) was the American spaceflight that first
      landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot
      Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at
      20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's
      surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin
      joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours
      together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing.
      Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to
      bring back to Earth as pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module
      Columbia in lunar orbit, and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36
      minutes before lifting off to rejoin Columbia. Apollo 11 was launched by a
      Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on
      July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA's Apollo
      program. The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module. with a
      cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a
      service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion,
      electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module that had two
      stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to
      place the astronauts back into lunar orbit. After being sent to the Moon
      by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft
      from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit.
      Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of
      Tranquility on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle's ascent stage to lift
      off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They
      jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled
      Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to
      Earth. They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on
      July 24 after more than eight days in space
